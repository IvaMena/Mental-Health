    <p>
      There are multiple types of depression, each with their own range of severity:
      <ul>

        <li>Persistent Depressive Disorder (formerly known as dysthymia)</li>
        <li>Major Depression (also known as clinical depression)</li>
        <li>Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (unique to anyone with a typical set of female reproductive organs)</li>
        <li>Bipolar Disorder (the really low end meets the criteria for Major Depression)</li>

      </ul>

      While there are situations that can worsen pre-existing depression,
      there is no true "cause" of depression.
