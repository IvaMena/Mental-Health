     People with mental health problems can get better and many recover completely.
 Studies show that people with mental health problems get better and many recover completely. Recovery refers to the process in which people are able to live, work, learn, and participate fully in their communities. There are more treatments, services, and community support systems than ever before, and they work.
Treatment for mental health problems varies depending on the individual and could include medication, therapy, or both. Many individuals work with a support system during the healing and recovery process.

<p>
    Friends and loved ones can make a big difference. Only 44% of adults with diagnosable mental health problems and less than 20% of children and adolescents receive needed treatment. Friends and family can be important influences to help someone get the treatment and services they need by:
      <ol>

        <li>Reaching out and letting them know you are available to help</li>
        <li>Helping them access mental health services</li>
        <li>Learning and sharing the facts about mental health, especially if you hear something that isn't true</li>
        <li>Treating them with respect, just as you would anyone else</li>
        <li>Refusing to define them by their diagnosis or using labels such as "crazy"</li>

      </ol>
