      <li>Note 2: I would have loved to go into the different types of anxiety and explain how each version of it is different, however we don't have enough time for that. I'll give you a link to a pretty helpful source below this note to learn more about the different types, though you should go gather more information before drawing your own conclusions. Luckily it also provides its own sources too.</li>

          Anxiety disorders in general are centered around excessive fear/anxiety causing its victim to display
          behavioral/functional disturbances as a result of the stress it creates. There are many different types of anxiety, each triggered by different situations.
          Some examples are seperation, selective mutism, social and other phobias, panic, substance-medication-induced, and generalized.
          They each have different causes and they all have different effects on how those inflicted by them live their lives.

      ! - Panic attacks: this is the abrupt onset of intense fear or discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes.
      Panic attacks leave the victim trembling with short breath, at times they feel like they can't breathe. These attacks last from 20 - 30 minutes and are unpredicatable, leaving people scared of when the next one will occur.
      NOTE: Anxiety attacks are similar, but they are short lived once the tigger/situation for this attack is gone.
